\section{Proof of Theorem 1}
\label{app:MinHamProof}
In order to prove NP-Hardness of Min-Ham-Path we show Ham-Path $\leq_p$ Min-Ham-Path. The Hamiltonian Path problem asks the following question: Given a directed graph $G(V,E)$ does there exist a path that goes through every node exactly once?\\

Given and instance of the Ham-Path problem $\left\langle G \right\rangle$ we modify graph $G(V,E)$ and generate a new graph $G'(V', E')$ where $V' = V \cup \left\{ o \right\}$ and $E' = E \cup \left\{ \left\langle o, v \right\rangle : v \in V \right\}$. Also, for every $e \in E'$ we Assume $l(e) = 1$.\\

Now we show that Ham-Path$\left\langle G \right\rangle$ is true \emph{iff} Min-Ham-Path$\left\langle G', l, o, n \right\rangle$ is true where $n$ is the number of vertices in $G$. If Min-Ham-Path returns a path of length $n$, we can remove the first edge from the path which will result in a Hamiltonian Path for the Ham-Path$\left\langle G \right\rangle$ problem. On the other hand every Hamiltonian Path on graph $G$ will have length $n-1$. By adding vertex $o$ and connecting it to the starting vertex, we end up with a Hamiltonian Path of length $n$ on $G'$.

\section{Proof of Theorem 2}
\label{app:TASCProof}
We start the proof by showing that the decision problem of TASC is NP. Given a matching M, we can check that no task is assigned to more than one worker in polynomial time. Also, we can find the value of M with a adding the value of every task in M.\\

Now we prove TASC is NP-Hard by Min-Ham-Path $\leq_p$ TASC. Given an instance of the Min-Ham-Path problem $\left\langle G(V,E), l, o, K \right\rangle$ we reduce it to an instance of the TASC$\left\langle W, T, l', n \right\rangle$ problem such that $W = \left\{ o \right\}$, $T = V \setminus \left\{ o \right\}$. For every task $t$ we set $t.v = 1$, $t.r = 0$ and $t.d = K$ (We assume workers travel one unit of length with every unit of time). Also for every $e \in E, l'(e) = l(e)$. In addition for every $e' \in \left( W \times T \right) \cup \left( T \times T \right) $ where $e' \not\in E$ we set $l'(e') = \infty$.\\ 

Finally we show the result of Min-Ham-Path$\left\langle G, l, o, K \right\rangle$ is true if TASC$\left\langle W, T, l', n-1 \right\rangle$ is true where $n$ is the number of vertices in $G$. Considering that $\left\vert T \right\vert = n - 1$ and $t.v = 1$ for every $t \in T$, if there exists a matching with size $n - 1$ it means every task has been assigned to the single worker. Also, since we set the deadline of every task to $K$ this means the worker visits every task no later than $K$. Therefore, the path that the worker traverses starts at $o$ and goes through every other vertex $v \in V \setminus \left\{ o \right\}$ where the length of the path is no more than $K$.
