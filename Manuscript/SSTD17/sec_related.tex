Many studies in spatial crowdsorcing research focus on the task assignment problem\cite{Kazemi12,Deng13,Li15,Chen15,Deng15,Cheng16,Fonteles15,Guo16}. Kazemi and Shahabi\cite{Kazemi12}, Cheng et. al.\cite{Cheng16} and Fonteles et. al.\cite{Fonteles15} formulate task assignment in spatial crowdsourcing as a matching problem. In \cite{Kazemi12,Fonteles15} the primary objective is to maximize the number of matched tasks while in \cite{Cheng16} the minimize the distance between the tasks and their matched workers. Furthermore, neither of these studies consider the schedule of a worker when matching tasks and workers. Deng el. al.\cite{Deng13} and Li et. al\cite{Li15} study the problem of scheduling tasks that have already been asigned to a worker. While in \cite{Deng13} all matched tasks are available at the time scheduling is performed, the authors look at the online version of the same problem in \cite{Li15} where the scheduling algorithm is performed immediately after a new task gets matched with the worker. More recent studies have considered both matching and scheduling using the batched scheme \cite{Chen15,Deng15,Guo16}. Chen et. al.\cite{Chen15} formulate the problem as in Integer Linear Program where the objective is to minimize the total traveled distance of the workers. In \cite{Deng15}, to process each batch, the algorithm first performs matching and then tries to schedule the matched tasks. For those tasks that did not get scheduled another round of matching and scheduling is performed and this continues until either all tasks are scheduled or there is no eligible worker remained for an unscheduled task. In \cite{Guo16}, Guo et. al. propose greedy-enhanced genetic algorithms for matching and scheduling time-sensitive and time-insensitive tasks separately. 

Our work is also related to some combinatorial optimization problems such as Vehicle Routing Problem(VRP) \cite{Braysy05}. The general setting of VRP is to serve a number of customers with a fleet of vehicles and the objective is to minimize the total travel cost of those vehicles. Compared with VRP, with spatial crowdsourcing our objective is to maximize the number of completed tasks, whereas VRP aims to minimize the total travel time. In addition, the spatial workers in our problem setting are not located at one or several fixed depots, and each worker can show up at any unique location. In our setting the spatial tasks are also not guaranteed to be completed by the workers. 
%Finally, in a spatial crowdsourcing platform, we need to provide efficient solutions for potentially millions of tasks and workers. This is different from the solutions in VRP which take hundreds of seconds even for one hundred delivery points.

%Auction frameworks have been used in various domains such as dynamic multi-agent environments \cite{Mehta05,Lagoudakis04} and online advertising \cite{Ghosh10}. Bidding strategies from other domains cannot be used in spatial crowdsourcing as they do not consider the spatial and temporal characteristics of SC. In this paper, we develop bidding strategies that are unique to a spatial crowdsourcing environment. One aspect of auction frameworks that has been widely studied is how to prevent bidders from submitting malicious bids to give themselves unfair advantage \cite{Lavi05}. This problem does not apply to our Auction-SC framework because here, the workers do not directly interact with the SC-Server. Instead, the software on a worker's phone receives tasks, computes bids and submits them to the server. If a task is assigned to a worker, the worker will be notified with an updated schedule through the software. The worker has no control over the software and hence, cannot cheat the system.

%Some recent studies in spatial matching \cite{Wong07,Long13} do focus on efficiency and use the spatial features of the objects for more efficient assignment. These studies assume a global knowledge about the locations of all objects exists a priori and the challenge comes from the complexity of spatial matching. However, spatial crowdsourcing differs due to the dynamism of tasks and workers (i.e., tasks and workers come and go without our knowledge), thus the challenge is to perform the task assignment at a given instance of time with the goal of global optimization across all times. Moreover, the fact that workers need to travel to task locations causes the landscape of the problem to change constantly. This will add another layer of dynamism to spatial crowdsourcing that makes it a unique problem.

%One can consider the task assignment problem in spatial crowdsourcing as a matching problem between tasks and workers, which makes it similar to the classic matching problem \cite{Gibbons85,Avis83}. In particular, the online matching problem \cite{Kalyanasundaram93, Kalyanasundaram00} is the most relevant variation to spatial crowdsourcing as it captures the dynamism of tasks arriving at different times. However, once the number of tasks assigned to one worker is more than one, the online matching problem cannot capture the true cost of performing tasks. More specifically, once you assign a set of tasks to a worker, the cost of executing this set is the distance of the shortest path that starts from the workerâ€™s current location and goes through the locations of all the assigned tasks. On the other hand, with online b-matching \cite{Kalyanasundaram00} the overall cost for one worker would be the sum of the distances between the worker and each assignedtask.

%Modeling the assignment cost as the shortest path a worker has to take to visit the locations of multiple tasks, brings another class of problems to attention. In this context the assignment problem in spatial crowdsourcing becomes similar to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) \cite{Lawler85} and the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) \cite{Toth02}. The online versions of both TSP and VRP have been studied to some extent where new locations to visit are revealed incrementally. Since there is only one salesman in the standard version of TSP, here we focus on VRP. Different variations of VRP have been studied, yet there are still some differences between task assignment in spatial crowdsourcing and these variations. In VRP, a server can pay a penalty and deny visiting a location; however, in spatial crowdsourcing the goal is to maximize the number of assigned tasks so the worker does not have the option of denying a task. Furthermore, in VRP, all servers start from the same depot where in spatial crowdsourcing each worker can have a different starting location. Moreover, in VRP we have a fixed number of servers whereas in spatial crowdsourcing the same type of dynamism for tasks can apply to the workers. That is, workers can be added (removed) to (from) the system at any time.
