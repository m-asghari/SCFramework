\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:future}

In this paper, we studied the problem of real-time task assignment and scheduling in spatial crowdsourcing. We showed that neither of the two current approaches for task assignment in spatial crowdsourcing, batched assignment and centralized online assignment, can scale as either task matching or task scheduling will become the bottleneck. Therefore, we introduced an auction-based framework in which we split the matching and scheduling responsibilities between SC-Server and workers, respectively. We showed that by exploiting the spatiotemporal aspects of SC, with our proposed algorithms, the workers will be able to complete up to 30\% more tasks as compared to non-SC approaches. The decentralized architecture of our framework allows for performing such high quality assignments at scale.

In this paper, we assumed each task can be performed instantaneously, e.g., taking a picture. Once that assumption is relaxed, we will face new challenges with scheduling the tasks. We also assumed each task requires the worker to travel to a single location. However, in other applications the worker may need to visit multiple locations for a single task, e.g., in the Uber application the worker has to pick up a passenger at one location and drop him off at a second location. We plan to extend our Auction-SC framework to incorporate these two features.
