\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:future}

In this paper we studied the problem of real-time task assignment and scheduling in spatial crowdsourcing. We introduced an auction-based framework in which we split the assignment and scheduling computations between the SC-Server and workers,respectively. We showed that by exploitingthe spatiotemporal aspects of SC, with our proposed algorithms, the workers will be able to complete up to 30\% more as tasks compared to non-SC approaches. The decentralized architecture of our framework allows for performing such high quality assignments at scale.

In this paper, we assumed each task can be performed instantaneously, e.g., taking a picture. Once that assumption is relaxed, we will face new challenges with scheduling the tasks. We also assumed each task requires the worker to travel to a single location. However, in other applications the worker may need to visit multiple locations for a single task, e.g., in the Uber application the worker has to pick up a passenger at one location and drop him off at a second location. We plan to extend our Auction-SC to incorporate these two features.
